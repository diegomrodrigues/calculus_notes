The Cartan homotopy formula relates the Lie derivative with the exterior derivative and the interior product: L\u1d65\u03b1 = \u03b9\u1d65(da) + d(\u03b9\u1d65\u03b1). The Lie derivative is equal to the commutator of the vector fields, Lw = [v, w] = vw - wv, connecting it to the algebraic properties of the vector fields."

        "The global formula for the Lie derivative of differential forms expresses L\u03bd\u03b1 in terms of directional derivatives and commutators, eliminating the need for local coordinates. For a 2-form \u03b1, the formula is (L\u03bd\u03b1)(w1, w2) = v[\u03b1(w1, w2)] - \u03b1([v, w1], w2) - \u03b1(w1, [v, w2]), generalizing to k-forms with k commutators.",
        "The global formula for the Lie derivative of a general tensor (r, s) involves weighted sums of directional derivatives and commutator terms, capturing the variation of the tensor along the flow. The relation between the Lie derivatives and the exterior differentiation is given by the Cartan homotopy formula: L\u1d65\u03b1 = \u03b9\u1d65(da) + d(\u03b9\u1d65\u03b1). The global formula for the exterior differentiation expresses da in terms of directional derivatives and commutators, providing a coordinate-independent definition.",
        "For a k-form \u03b1, the formula is (da)(v0, ..., vk) = \u03a3 (-1)\u2071 vi[\u03b1(v0, ..., \u1e7di, ..., vk)] + \u03a3 (-1)\u2071\u207a\u02b2 \u03b1([vi, vj], v0, ..., \u1e7di, ..., \u1e7dj, ..., vk), where \u1e7di indicates the omission of the term vi."
