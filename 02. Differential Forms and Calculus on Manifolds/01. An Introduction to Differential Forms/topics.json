        "Discussion on manifolds, tangent spaces, and vector fields to provide an intuitive idea of what they are, preparing for a more rigorous treatment. A manifold is introduced as a space that is locally Euclidean, where a small part resembles R^n for some n, exemplified with a circle (S^1), a sphere (S^2), and a torus (T). The tangent space at a point 'good' point has the same dimension as the manifold at that point, being isomorphic to the vector space R^n.",
        "Directional derivatives are adapted from vector calculus for specific purposes, leading to an identification between standard Euclidean unit vectors and differential operators. The directional derivative of a function f: R^n -> R at a point p in the direction of a vector v is given by Dvf(p) = lim(t->0) [f(p + tv) - f(p)]/t, quantifying the rate of change of f along v.",

Illustration of how the elements of the dual basis {dx1, dx2, dx3} act on a vector, finding the projections of the vector onto the appropriate axes. Discussion on how to write a 1-form as a linear combination of {dx, dy, dz}, behaving as expected.
