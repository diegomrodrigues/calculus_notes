        "The divergence measures how much a vector field 'diverges' or 'spreads out' from a point, quantifying the rate of expansion or contraction of the vector field's flux per unit volume at that point. Geometrically, it's defined as the limit of the surface integral of the flux of the vector field through the boundary of a volume, divided by that volume, as the volume shrinks to a point. In Cartesian coordinates, for a vector field F = P\u00ee + Q\u0135 + Rk, the divergence is given by div F = \u2202P/\u2202x + \u2202Q/\u2202y + \u2202R/\u2202z, where P, Q, and R are the components of the vector field in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. The divergence can also be expressed in cylindrical and spherical coordinates using specific formulas that account for the geometry of each coordinate system, facilitating calculations in situations with cylindrical or spherical symmetry. Physically, divergence relates to the density of sources or sinks in a vector field: a positive divergence indicates a source, a negative divergence indicates a sink, and zero divergence indicates a solenoidal field.",
        "The Divergence Theorem (also known as Gauss's Theorem) relates the surface integral of the flux of a vector field through a closed surface to the volume integral of the divergence of the field over the volume enclosed by the surface. This allows for converting flux problems into divergence problems, and vice versa.  Mathematically, it states that the integral of the divergence of a vector field over a volume is equal to the flux of the vector field across the surface enclosing that volume. This theorem is a generalization of the fundamental theorem of calculus."

Geometrically, it measures the 'circulation' per unit area of a vector field at a point, obtained as the limit of the line integral of the vector field around a closed curve divided by the area of the surface bounded by the curve, indicating the vector field's tendency to induce rotation. In Cartesian coordinates, for a vector field F = P\u00ee + Q\u0135 + Rk, the curl is given by curl F = (\u2202R/\u2202y - \u2202Q/\u2202z)\u00ee + (\u2202P/\u2202z - \u2202R/\u2202x)\u0135 + (\u2202Q/\u2202x - \u2202P/\u2202y)k.
