        "Iterated integrals are defined independently of double integrals, by computing the partial integral of a function f(x, y) with respect to y for each x in the interval [a, b], resulting in a continuous function of x. This involves integrating f(x, y) with respect to y from \u03b3(x) to \u03b4(x), where \u03b3(x) and \u03b4(x) are continuous functions that define the limits of the region S in the xy plane, resulting in a continuous function of x. Similarly, one can compute the partial integral of f(x, y) with respect to a variable (y or x) keeping the other constant, resulting in a function F(x) or F(y). The partial integral F(x) is calculated by integrating f(x, y) with respect to y from \u03b3(x) to \u03b4(x).",

Inverting the order of integration involves starting with a region T defined by c \u2264 y \u2264 d and \u03b1(y) \u2264 x \u2264 \u03b2(y), calculating the partial integral of f(x, y) with respect to x from \u03b1(y) to \u03b2(y) for each y in the interval [c, d]. The process of inverting the roles of the variables in iterated integration allows calculating partial integrals with respect to x first and then with respect to y, provided the region of integration is adequately described in terms of continuous limits \u03b1(y) \u2264 x \u2264 \u03b2(y) and c \u2264 y \u2264 d.",
