Geometrically, the set of points that satisfy f(x, y) = k forms a curve in the (x, y) plane, representing the graph of the function y = \u03c6(x). This concept extends to multiple dimensions where x and y can be vectors, and f(x, y) = k can represent a system of equations.",
        "The Implicit Function Theorem establishes conditions under which it is possible to determine the function \u03c6 from the relation f, or at least guarantee its existence, even when its exact form cannot be found.  It states that if f(x, y) has continuous derivatives in a neighborhood of a point (a, b), and f(a, b) = k with fy(a, b) \u2260 0, then there exists a unique function y = \u03c6(x) defined and continuously differentiable in an open interval I containing a, such that f(x, \u03c6(x)) = k for all x in I, \u03c6(a) = b, and \u03c6'(x) = -fx(x, \u03c6(x)) / fy(x, \u03c6(x)).",
        "A point (a, b) is considered a 'seed' if f(a, b) = k, allowing the function y = \u03c6(x) to 'grow' from that point. However, the implicit function may be local, defined only in part of the set of points f(x, y) = k. Different parts of the set of points may originate different implicit functions. The existence of an implicit function depends on the non-existence of impediments, such as the relation f(x, y) = k not possessing pairs (x, y) that satisfy it, or the function being defined only locally in part of the locus f(x, y) = k. A critical point of a differentiable function f(x, y) is a point (a, b) where fx(a, b) = fy(a, b) = 0. The Implicit Function Theorem does not apply at critical points, as the condition fy(a, b) \u2260 0 is not satisfied. A point (a, b) is a regular point if at least one of the partial derivatives is non-zero.",

The linearization of the locus at (a, b) is the equation fx(a, b)\u0394x + fy(a, b)\u0394y = 0, representing a line tangent to the locus at (a, b). If fy(a, b) \u2260 0, we can solve the linearized equation for \u0394y, obtaining \u0394y = -[fx(a, b) / fy(a, b)]\u0394x, implying the tangent has a finite slope m = -fx(a, b) / fy(a, b).",

The derivative of \u03c6 is given by \u03c6'(\u03b1) = -[fx(\u03b1, \u03c6(\u03b1))] / fy(\u03b1, \u03c6(\u03b1)), where \u03b1 is a point near a and \u03c6(\u03b1) = b. The condition fy(a, b) \u2260 0 implies that fy(x, y) \u2260 0 for all (x, y) sufficiently close to (a, b), allowing solving for \u03c6'(x)."

A suitably chosen coordinate change will 'straighten' these contours, implying there's essentially only one way to arrange the contours near a regular point.

The transformation h is a nonlinear shear that maps each vertical line onto itself, stretching it by different amounts at different points.
