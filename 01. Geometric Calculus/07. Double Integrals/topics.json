        "Double integrals are used to calculate the product of quantities that vary spatially, such as the gravitational force exerted by a homogeneous plate on a point above it. This involves approximating the plate by dividing it into small cells and summing the contributions of each cell to estimate the total gravitational field. The integral of Riemann emerges as the limit of the Riemann sums when the cells become infinitely small, representing the product of two variable quantities (such as force field and area) restricted to small cells where they become almost constant, allowing calculating the numerical value of the integral. The universal law of gravitation of Newton motivates the use of double integrals in calculating the gravitational force exerted between masses, proportional to the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance. This involves the concept of a vector field, particularly the gravitational field, defined as a vector function of the position that describes the acceleration of a test particle due to the presence of a mass; calculation of the total gravitational force exerted by a continuous mass distribution.",
        "Double integrals are evaluated through iterated integrals, involving successive integration with respect to each variable while keeping the other constant, allowing calculating the volume under a surface or the total mass of a sheet. The geometric calculation allows defining double integrals as the limit of the product of two quantities that vary continuously over a two-dimensional region, extending the notion of integral to functions of multiple variables. The rigorous mathematical theory establishes that double integrals can be evaluated through iterated integrals, where the integration is performed successively in relation to each variable, allowing the practical calculation of areas and volumes.",
        "Improper integrals are used when the integration limits are infinite or the integrated function is unbounded, calculating the integral as a function of a finite limit and then taking the limit of that function when the finite limit tends to infinity, allowing determining the value of the integral even when the limits are unlimited. The rigorous definition of the improper integral is used to treat cases where the integration domain is unlimited or the integrated function is unlimited; the value of the integral is determined as a limit when the integration limits approach infinity. Improper integrals are defined as limits of double integrals over regions that extend to infinity or contain singularities, allowing the calculation of areas and volumes in more general situations.",
        "In polar coordinates, the double integral is expressed in terms of r and \u03b8, where the area element dA is replaced by r dr d\u03b8, allowing calculating integrals over regions with radial symmetry, such as the gravitational force of a circular plate, dividing the plate into concentric rings and summing the contributions of each ring. The transformation to polar coordinates simplifies double integrals over regions with circular symmetry, allowing the integral to be expressed in terms of radial and angular variables, thus facilitating the evaluation of the integral. The transformation to polar coordinates facilitates the calculation of double integrals in regions with radial symmetry, changing the area element and simplifying the expression of the integral, which is fundamental in problems of physics and engineering. The calculation of the gravitational field of a circular plate using polar coordinates explores the circular symmetry to simplify the integral; the transformation to polar coordinates leads to an improper integral of a variable.",
        "The Jordan content is a precise measure of the size (area) of a region, built by partitioning the region into small pieces and summing their sizes, allowing calculating the area of complex shapes, such as those resulting from transformations of variables. The concept of Jordan content provides a precise definition of area for regions in the plane, essential for the rigorous definition of the double integral and to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the result. The Jordan content provides a precise notion of size that captures the intuitive ideas about area, extends immediately to higher dimensions and fits well with the integration process.",
        "A set is Jordan measurable if and only if the Jordan content of its boundary is zero, meaning that the boundary of the set must be sufficiently 'thin' for the set to have a well-defined Jordan content, connecting the Jordan measurability with the area of the boundary of the set. Subsets of sets with zero Jordan content also have zero Jordan content, and the union of a finite number of sets with zero Jordan content also has zero Jordan content.",
        "The graph of a continuous function in a limited interval has zero Jordan content, implying that the area under the curve of a continuous function can be calculated using the Riemann integral. If S and T are Jordan measurable sets, then their unions and intersections are also Jordan measurable, and if S and T are Jordan measurable sets that do not overlap, then the Jordan content of their union is the sum of their Jordan contents."
