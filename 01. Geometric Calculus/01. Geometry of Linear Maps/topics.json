        "Linear maps, such as x \u2192 y = mx, scale lengths by a factor 'm'. In higher dimensions, M: R\u207f \u2192 R\u207f has multiplication factors affecting differentials in multiple integrals, similar to p'(s) in the transformation dx = p'(s)ds. These maps illustrate geometric transformations, altering lengths and directions.",
        "Specific linear maps demonstrate various transformations. M\u2081 = [[2, 0], [0, 3]] scales horizontal lengths by 2 and vertical lengths by 3. M\u2082 = [[1, 0], [0, -1]] reflects the plane across the horizontal axis, inverting orientation. M\u2083 = [[0, -2], [2, 0]] rotates by \u03c0/2 radians (90\u00b0) and dilates uniformly by a factor of 2. These examples showcase scaling, reflection, and rotation-dilation combinations.",
        "Invariant lines and their multipliers geometrically characterize a linear map. Two maps with the same multipliers acting on the same invariant lines are identical. A vector U \u2260 0 is an eigenvector of M with eigenvalue \u03bb if MU = \u03bbU. The eigenvalue \u03bb can be zero, indicating M has a non-trivial kernel consisting of eigenvectors with eigenvalue zero. The condition MU = \u03bbU can be rewritten as (M - \u03bbI)U = 0, where I is the identity matrix.",
        "The expression p(\u03bb) = det(M - \u03bbI) is a polynomial in \u03bb called the characteristic polynomial of M. The equation p(\u03bb) = 0 is the characteristic equation of M. Each eigenvalue of M is a root of its characteristic equation. The sum of the eigenvalues of a 2x2 matrix is equal to its trace, and the product is equal to its determinant.",
        "Equivalent matrices represent the same linear map in different coordinates, related by a change-of-basis matrix G, where B = G\u207b\u00b9AG. These matrices share eigenvalues, trace, determinant, and characteristic polynomial, indicating these properties are invariant under coordinate changes.",
        "Shear transformations combine stretching with displacement parallel to an invariant line, resulting in only one invariant direction. Matrices with a zero eigenvalue cause collapse along the eigenvector's direction; these are categorized as collapses, with shear-collapse as a special case. Linear maps are classified into equivalence classes based on eigenvalues and eigendirections.",
        "Area multipliers, determined by the determinant, quantify how a linear map scales areas. The sign indicates whether the map preserves or reverses orientation. The wedge product (v \u2227 w) denotes the parallelogram spanned by vectors v and w, with orientation determined by the vector order and signed area given by the determinant.",
        "In three dimensions, the cross-product (x \u00d7 y) yields a vector orthogonal to x and y, with length equal to the area of the parallelogram they span, oriented by the right-hand rule. The scalar triple product (x \u00d7 y) \u00b7 z gives the signed volume of the parallelepiped spanned by x, y, and z, equivalent to the determinant of the matrix with x, y, z as columns.",
        "The volume multiplier for a linear map in three dimensions is the determinant, indicating how volumes are scaled, with the sign determining orientation preservation or reversal. In n-dimensional space, an ordered set of vectors has positive orientation if the determinant of the linear map taking the standard basis to those vectors is positive. The oriented n-dimensional parallelepiped is defined using the wedge product, and its volume is given by the determinant."
